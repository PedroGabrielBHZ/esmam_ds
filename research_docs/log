	- Code moved to /code/IC
		* Each project has its git, one for ESMAM and another for ESMAM-DS
	- Watched Juliana's presentation

	- Tried executing esmam_ds through "python3 main.py" @ code/esmam_ds/
	- Error in rule.py -> self.get_terms(attr_intersec).issubset(rule.get_terms()) :: too many arguments.
		-> Making correction, rule.py, line 58;
			- Removed attr_intersec from function .get_terms(). It shouldn't take any input but self.
	- After correction, main.py executed to exp 4 until RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded in comparison.
		-> Image of execution at docs/images/print
		-> Apparently from _abc_instancecheck(cls, instance)
		-> Executed twice and got the same error.
		-> No ideias on correction a.t.m.
	- ant_index variable is initialized to 0 in EsmamDS.fit(), but Parpinelli paper says 1. Added a comment.
	- What exactly is log_ants (besides a dict)

	- How exactly does the implementation work? What is the code supposed to do, quick review.
	- exp iterations stand for statistical experiment, what is the experiment?
